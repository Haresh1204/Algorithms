**Single Linked List**


**Single linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has link to its next element in the sequence.**

In any single linked list, the individual element is called as "Node". Every "Node" contains two fields, data field, and the next field. The data field is used to store actual value of the node and next field is used to store the address of next node in the sequence.

The graphical representation of a node in a single linked list is as follows...

**Operations on Single Linked List**

The following operations are performed on a Single Linked List

**1.Insertion**

**2.Deletion**

**3.Display**

Before we implement actual operations, first we need to set up an empty list. First, perform the following steps before implementing actual operations.

Step 1 - Include all the header files which are used in the program.

Step 2 - Declare all the user defined functions.

Step 3 - Define a Node structure with two members data and next

Step 4 - Define a Node pointer 'head' and set it to NULL.

Step 5 - Implement the main method by displaying operations menu and make suitable function calls in the main method to perform user selected operation.

**Output**
